== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What Happened To This Release? =

We have merged our PREMIUM edition and LE edition into a single product.  The LE is now fully functional with no restrictions.  We have created add-on packs that provided extended features and functionality.

= What About My License? =

If you purchased a premium license you can enter it as the key for the Pro Pack add-on and enable the extended features such as the themes system.

= How Do I Switch? =

The cleanest way to switch is to deactivate and delete your premium edition plugin.

Once that is done use the admin panel "Add New Pluging" feature and search for "moneypress" to find our plugins.  Select the non-defunct release.

= Will My Settings Be Retained? =

Yes, all your settings EXCEPT YOUR LICENSE KEY will be retained.  Copy that key and re-use it for your add-on pack license.
